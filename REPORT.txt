(Q1) What is the performance difference between v1, v2 and v3 where you run v2 and v3 both 
in a single Hadoop process and "pseudo" distributed processes.

v1 Job took                                 1 hour 37 minutes 21 seconds 
v2 Job on an average takes        6mins, 42sec
v3 Job on an average takes        6mins, 20sec



(Q2) Comparing v(3) with v4, what is the largest value of N that does not affect performance?

v4 -  6mins, 32sec    N = 100
v4 -  6mins, 24sec    N = 200
v4 -  6mins, 43sec    N = 300
v4 -  6mins, 33sec    N = 500
v4 -  6mins, 27sec    N = 650
v4 -  6mins, 52sec    N = 800
v4 -  7mins, 14sec    N = 1000


(Q3) How many instances of the reducer are running?  The input file is (here 1.7GB txt file).

Only 1 instance of reducer runs for all versions of the job.
